# 🔧 Temperature-Based Predictive Maintenance Project

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect machine failures based on temperature and other sensor data.

## 📁 Files Included

- `temperature_pdm_notebook.ipynb`: Complete code for data analysis, training, and evaluation
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter
- scikit-learn
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## 🚀 Steps

1. Upload the dataset in Colab
2. Follow the notebook to preprocess, train, and evaluate
3. Analyze feature importance and draw conclusions

## 📊 Output

- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
- Feature importance plot

## ✅ Conclusion

Temperature is a key predictor for identifying potential machine failures. This project shows how predictive maintenance can reduce unplanned downtime using machine learning models.
